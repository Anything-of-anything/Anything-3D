<!-- # Anything-3D -->

🎉🎉🎉Welcome to the Anything-3D GitHub repository!🎉🎉🎉 

- 🔥[Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10261) is out🔥
- 🔥[Open-source Code](https://github.com/Anything-of-anything/Anything-3D/tree/main/AnyObject3D) is out🔥

Here we present a project where we combine [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) with a series of 3D models to create a very interesting demo. This is currently a small project, but we plan to continue improving it and creating more exciting demos.

**Contributions are highly Welcomed!🤝🙌**

## 🤩 Anything-3D-Objects

In this section, we showcase the results of combining [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) with [3DFuse](https://github.com/KU-CVLAB/3DFuse) to segment and reconstruct 3D objects in the wild. Check out the following table for segmentation results and the corresponding 3D object:


| Segmentation | Result|
| :---: | :---:|

| <img src="AnyObject3D/assets/corgi_mask.png" width="550">| ![2](AnyObject3D/assets/corgi.gif) |

## 🔥 Anything-3DNovel-View

In this section, we demonstrate the combination of [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) with [Zero 1-to-3](https://github.com/cvlab-columbia/zero123) to generate novel views of 3D objects. Check out the following images:

## 🥳 Anything-NeRF

In this section, we showcase the integration of [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) with [NeRF](https://github.com/kwea123/nerf_pl) to generate new perspectives of objects set against intricate backgrounds. When an object is positioned in front of a plain, perspective-less background, NeRF typically struggles to reconstruct the scene. However, by eliminating the background, we can enhance NeRF's performance and facilitate more accurate reconstructions of scenes with objects presented in novel views.

## 😎 Any-3DFace

In this section, we showcase the results of combining [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) with [HRN](https://younglbw.github.io/HRN-homepage/) for accurate and detailed face reconstruction from in-the-wild images. Check out the following table for segmentation results and the corresponding face reconstruction:
